# NetHacks
A couple of hacks for a rooted Android device for the network

At the moment, this project is not maintained, but works as it should.

Designed for a rooted device with Magisk, systemlessly as the adblock uses the Magisk system-less functionality.

It will NOT work for a rooted device which has modifications done to /system!

This app at the moment has 3 features:
- Adblock (Uses https://github.com/Zackptg5/Unified-Hosts-Adblock)
- Packet forwarding (A switch to enable/disable packet forwarding)
- Redirect DNS (Redirects DNS queries to a custom address, and port)
